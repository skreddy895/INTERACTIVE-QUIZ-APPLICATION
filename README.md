As part of my internship at CodTech, I was given the task of creating my own portfolio website. The aim was to make a website that looks good, works on all devices, and has smooth animations. I used modern tools and a popular animation library called GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) to make the site more interactive and professional.

For this project, I used several technologies. I started with HTML to build the basic structure of the website. It included different sections such as About Me, Skills, and Contact. Then, I used CSS to add styles like background colors, hover effects, and rounded cards. This helped make the website more attractive. I also used JavaScript for interactive effects, especially when working with GSAP animations. GSAP helped me animate different parts of the page, such as text and cards, when the site loads. Finally, I uploaded my project to GitHub so I could save my progress and share the site with others easily.

One of the best things about my website is that it's responsive, which means it adjusts to look good on phones, tablets, and computers. I added animations using GSAP so that the sections appear with smooth transitions. Instead of adding my full LinkedIn profile, I included a small LinkedIn icon that links to my profile. This makes the site look clean and still professional. I also kept the design simple, using soft colors and clean fonts so that everything is easy to read.

This task was very helpful for me. It taught me how to make a complete website using real-world tools and methods. I learned how to structure a site properly, make it look nice, and add cool effects with animations. It also helped me understand how version control works using GitHub. Most importantly, it gave me a platform where I can show my skills to teachers, interviewers, or clients.

Overall, I really enjoyed working on this portfolio. It was a great learning experience and gave me more confidence in frontend web development. This kind of project will also be useful for my future career, freelance work, or even as an online resume.
